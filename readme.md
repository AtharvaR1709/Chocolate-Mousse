Chocolate Mousse may well be the ultimate chocolate fix! 

Rich and creamy, yet light and fluffy, one pot is satisfying but always leaves me wanting more…….

This is a classic chocolate mousse made the proper French way, as served in fine dining restaurants. 

Less cream, more chocolate, a more intense chocolate flavour and a beautiful creamy mouth feel.
